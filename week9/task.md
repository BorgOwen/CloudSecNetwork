## üìù Description

Register a free domain name on freenom.com and connect it to AWS ROUTE 53 by updating the nameservers with those from your hosted zone. 

Create a cloudfront distribution that serves your S3 static website, then request and validate a free SSL certificate using ACM with DNS validation in route 53.

## üß≠ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Register a Free Domain on Freenom**

1. Go to [https://www.freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com)
2. Search for a free domain (e.g. `mycloudsite.ml`)
3. Click ‚ÄúGet it now‚Äù ‚Üí Checkout
4. Choose **12 months FREE**, and register
5. Open **Freenom Client Area > My Domains**
6. Click **Manage Domain > Management Tools > Nameservers**

   * Change from `Use default` to:

     ```
     Use custom nameservers:
     ns-xxxx.awsdns-xx.org
     ns-xxxx.awsdns-xx.co.uk
     ns-xxxx.awsdns-xx.com
     ns-xxxx.awsdns-xx.net
     ```
   * These come from your Route 53 Hosted Zone (we‚Äôll get them in the next step)

‚úÖ Save ‚Äî but DNS updates may take 10‚Äì30 minutes to propagate

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53**

1. Go to **Route 53 > Hosted Zones**
2. Click **Create hosted zone**

   * Domain name: `yourdomain.ml` (exactly as registered)
   * Type: **Public hosted zone**
3. Click **Create**

You'll now see **4 nameservers** under **NS record**. Copy these and paste them into **Freenom** (step above).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your Website to S3**

1. Create an S3 bucket named **exactly your domain**, e.g., `mycloudsite.ml`
2. Enable **static website hosting**
3. Upload your `index.html` (and optional `error.html`)
4. Set a **bucket policy** to allow public access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mycloudsite.ml/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Request SSL Certificate from ACM (for HTTPS)**

1. Go to **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)**
2. Click **Request certificate**

   * Choose **Request a public certificate**
   * Add domain: `mycloudsite.ml`
   * Add another: `www.mycloudsite.ml` (optional redirect)
3. Choose **DNS validation**
4. Click **Next** > **Request**

Now ACM gives you a **CNAME record** for validation.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Domain in Route 53**

1. Go back to your Hosted Zone
2. Click **Create record**
3. Paste the **CNAME name** and **value** ACM gave you
4. Save

‚úÖ ACM will automatically validate it (within 5‚Äì15 mins). When done, status becomes **‚ÄúIssued‚Äù**.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Create CloudFront Distribution**

1. Go to **CloudFront > Create Distribution**
2. Origin settings:

   * **Origin domain**: select your **S3 static website endpoint**
     (*Looks like: `mycloudsite.ml.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com` ‚Äî must be the **website endpoint**, not the REST API endpoint*)
   * **Protocol**: HTTP only
3. Default behavior:

   * Viewer Protocol Policy: **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
   * Allow all methods: GET, HEAD
4. Alternate domain (CNAME):

   * Add: `mycloudsite.ml`
   * Add: `www.mycloudsite.ml` (optional)
5. **SSL Certificate**:

   * Select **‚ÄúCustom SSL Certificate (ACM)‚Äù**
   * Choose the one you requested earlier
6. Default root object: `index.html`
7. Click **Create Distribution**

Wait for status to become **‚ÄúDeployed‚Äù** (\~10‚Äì20 minutes)

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Add Route 53 Alias Record to Point to CloudFront**

1. Go to **Route 53 > Hosted Zones**
2. Click your domain
3. Create a **new record**

   * Name: leave empty (this means root domain)
   * Type: **A ‚Äì IPv4**
   * Alias: **Yes**
   * **Alias Target**: Select your CloudFront distribution
4. (Optional) Create another for `www` subdomain pointing to CloudFront

‚úÖ This connects your **domain name to CloudFront**.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your Site**

* Visit: `https://mycloudsite.ml`
  ‚úÖ You should see your static site load securely via HTTPS!
